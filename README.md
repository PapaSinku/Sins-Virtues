# Sins-Virtues
## **welcome to Sins & Virtues Toturial**

This game is completely text based. There are **no** maps(yet), **no** hint, **no** eagle vision, **no** nothing.
But that does not mean that you are completely blind! The protagonist constantly talks about his surroundings, everything he says is there for a reason, so don't skip all the dialogs!

## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

Everytime you see a little **>** on the screen it's your turn to play the game. You have a handful of commands that you can use in every situation that you can see by typing *commands*.

Each of the commands that you can use do use some time, this becomes important specially in the fights where losing time could mean death.

We suggest testing and exploring the commnads by yourself, but if you want more info on some commands you can view the Commands.md file.

## Shops

There are some shops located in the game that you can use to sell your unwanted items and buy the things you want. The currencies in this game are **coins**.

Not all shopkeepers are the same, some have higher prices, some buy your items at a higher price. explore and find the shopkeeper that suits you the best.

## Homes

Homes can be used to rest the night and restore your hp. It also usualy contains a good item inside.
But not all homes are empty. Enter with **caution**.

## Fights

Fights in this game are text based. The only command for attacking that you have is "attack" that uses the equipped item to attack the enemy.

Each move you or your enemy make in a fight uses some time, the turnes in the fight are calculated by using that time.

**always** make sure to have equipped your best weapon before exploring into the unknown. You never know when the next enemy is going to fight you and that extra *equip* might be what saves or kills you in the end.

## **Castle**
To finish the game, you need to find the castle and explore it completely to the end. You have 2 options to find the castle:
*    explore blindly untill you come across the castle block
*    find a compass. by using a compass the compass directs you to the castle location.

**Always go into the castle prepared. The enemies in there will kill you easily if you are not well prepared.**



Happy Exploring, goodnight!
